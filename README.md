Relies on docker (Dockerfile) - guaranteed quick way to compile and release the APK.

Build the APK seamlessly following the steps:
- Optional: edit android/release.sh when needed:
```sh
KEYSTORE_FILE="my-release-key.jks"
KEY_ALIAS="my-key"
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD="your_keystore_password"
KEY_PASSWORD="your_key_password"
```
- Run Docker Script Runner:
```sh
# use sudo if needed for docker
# This will take time given your PC performance (couple of minutes up to 30 minutes)
# When done, the app-release.apk is generated within the BoldWallet folder

> sh docker-apk-builder.sh --fdroid #optional, for F-Droid foss tailored build
> sh docker-apk-builder.sh --fdroid --git=main #optional, which git "branch,tag, or commit-hash" to use
```
